# Windev: Location Based Wikipedia

## Overview

The **Windev** project is a location-based Wikipedia web application that draws inspiration from video game codecs and intel records regarding landmarks. It aims to enhance the travel and exploration experience by mimicking the concept of intel gathering in video games, making travel more rewarding and learning more dynamic. The public web application offers users a convenient way to study or research a particular location nearby within seconds. Users can access location details, save locations, set destinations, and even listen to information through the application.

## Motivation

The development of **Windev** was motivated by the challenges faced by individuals when visiting new locations. People often feel clueless and lost when encountering unfamiliar buildings or landmarks, leading to a lack of engagement and limited exploration.
